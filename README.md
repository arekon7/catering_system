System aimed for two main user types: catering companies and their customers. Catering companies could register their company and add branches, add necessary information about it, upload photos, create food menu, draw tables schemas. Customers could search through catering companies, make orders from food menu, book a table from table schema. 
Third user type - admin, could manage all users and companies accounts, edit their data and delete.
